## 📝 Description

React Movie App is a modern web application that allows users to **search**, **view**, and **manage** movies using data fetched from **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**.

Users can browse movie details, add movies to a Favourites list, and manage their collection — all while experiencing a clean, responsive, and interactive UI built with React.

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals such as **useState**, **useEffect**, **React Router**, **props**, and **conditional rendering**, while also working with real-world APIs and data fetching.
